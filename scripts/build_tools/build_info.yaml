# This yaml file is a configuration file that build.sh script uses. This yaml configuration is used by build.sh script
# when it is invoked with all (build.sh all). The structure of this file is the following:
# projects: 'Under this, the repository projects are described'
#   - project_name: 'Based on the name given here, the build.sh script will discover the relevant project folder. All projects are under root_repo/projects/<project_name>'
#     build_all: 'true or false: signals the build.sh script that this project should be included in the <build.sh all> procedure'
#     dfu_image: 'This section is to provide the build.sh script with information related to the python script that creates the firmware update image.'
#       enabled: 'true or false: signals the build.sh script that the binary of this project should be post-processed by the firmware update script'
#       binary_path: 'the path/to/binary, relative to the root of the repository'
#       linker_script: 'the path/to/linker_script, relative to the root of the repository'
#       version: 'Version information for the firmware update binary. Will be used by the firmware update script to append the version info to the final binary'
#         major:
#         minor:
#         patch:
#       private_key_path: 'the path/to/private_key, relative to the root of the repository' This is needed for the firmware update script to sign the binary.
#     create_public_key: 'This section is to provide the build.sh script with information related to the python script that creates the public key.'
#       enabled: 'true or false: signals the build.sh script that the public key should be created'
